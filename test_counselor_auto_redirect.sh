echo ""

echo "Current Date: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d')"

echo "1. Changes Made:"
echo "   ✅ Modified Dashboard.jsx to redirect counselors to counselor-dashboard with today's date"
echo "   ✅ Counselor route '/counselor-dashboard' already handles missing date parameter"
echo "   ✅ CounselorDashboard component has existing redirect logic for missing dates"
echo ""

echo "2. Expected Behavior After Login:"
echo "   - Counselor logs in successfully"
echo "   - Dashboard.jsx detects counselor role"
echo "   - Automatically redirects to: /counselor-dashboard/$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')"
echo "   - Date picker shows today's date selected"
echo "   - No need for manual navigation"
echo ""

echo "3. Testing Scenarios:"
echo "   Scenario A: Direct login redirect"
echo "   - User logs in with counselor role"
echo "   - Should land on counselor dashboard for today"
echo ""
echo "   Scenario B: Accessing /counselor-dashboard without date"
echo "   - Should redirect to /counselor-dashboard/$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')"
echo ""
echo "   Scenario C: Date picker functionality"
echo "   - Should initialize with today's date"
echo "   - Future dates should be disabled for counselors"
echo ""

echo "4. Implementation Details:"
echo "   - Dashboard.jsx now redirects counselors automatically"
echo "   - CounselorDashboard has robust date handling"
echo "   - SingleDatePicker restricts future dates for counselors"
echo "   - All existing functionality preserved"
echo ""

echo "5. Manual Testing Instructions:"
