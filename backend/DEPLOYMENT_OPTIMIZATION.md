# Development deployment strategies for BunkLogs

## Current Problem
- **Every deployment rebuilds everything** (5-15 minutes)
- No Docker layer caching between deployments
- Heavy dependencies get reinstalled every time

## Immediate Solutions (Today)

### 1. 🎯 **Use the optimized Dockerfile.eb** 
Your current `Dockerfile.eb` is actually pretty good! The main improvements:
```bash
# Switch to this for deployment:
cp Dockerfile.eb Dockerfile
eb deploy
```

### 2. ⚡ **Code-Only Changes (Super Fast)**
For Python code changes only (no requirements changes):
```bash
# If you only changed .py files, use:
eb deploy --staged  # Only deploys staged git changes
```

### 3. 🛠️ **Optimize Docker Layers**
```dockerfile
# Key optimization: Copy requirements first (better caching)
COPY requirements/ /app/requirements/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements/production.txt
# Then copy code (this layer changes frequently)
COPY . /app/
```

## Medium-term Solutions (This Week)

### 4. 🏗️ **Pre-built Base Images**
Create a base image with all dependencies:
```bash
# Build base image once
docker build -t bunklogs-base:latest -f Dockerfile.base .
docker push your-registry/bunklogs-base:latest

# App deployments just add code (30 seconds instead of 15 minutes)
FROM your-registry/bunklogs-base:latest
COPY . /app/
```

### 5. 🔄 **Enable EB Docker Caching**
Add to `.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml`:
```yaml
deploy:
  artifact: docker-compose.yml
global:
  default_platform: Docker
```

## Long-term Solutions (Next Month)

### 6. 🚀 **GitHub Actions CI/CD**
- Build images on code push
- Deploy pre-built images to EB
- 2-3 minute deployments instead of 15+

### 7. ☁️ **Switch to AWS ECS/Fargate**
- Better Docker layer caching
- Blue/green deployments
- Rolling updates

## Quick Wins for Today

1. **Use the requirements caching pattern** ✅ (already in Dockerfile.eb)
2. **Improve .dockerignore** ✅ (done)
3. **Only deploy changed files:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   eb deploy --staged
   ```

## Expected Speed Improvements

| Current | Optimized | Time Saved |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| 15 min  | 5-8 min   | 7-10 min   |
| 15 min  | 2-3 min   | 12-13 min (with base image) |
| 15 min  | 30 sec    | 14.5 min (with CI/CD) |

## What to Do Right Now

1. Use your existing `Dockerfile.eb` - it's already optimized
2. Make sure requirements are cached properly
3. For quick code changes, use `eb deploy --staged`

The 5-15 minute build time is mostly unavoidable with current EB setup, but we can get to 2-3 minutes with some optimizations!
