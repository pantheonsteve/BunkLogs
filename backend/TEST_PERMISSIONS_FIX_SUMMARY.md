# Test Permissions Fix Summary

## Issue
The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing because 5 out of 9 tests in `bunk_logs.api.tests.test_permissions.CounselorPermissionsTest` were failing with `NoReverseMatch` errors and incorrect permission behavior.

## Root Causes

### 1. URL Name Mismatches
The tests were using incorrect URL names that didn't match the actual URL patterns:
- `'bunk-logs-info'` → should be `'bunklog-by-date'`
- `'bunklogs-list'` → should be `'bunklog-list'`

### 2. Serializer Field Requirements
The `BunkLogSerializer` was requiring a `counselor` field for POST requests, but the view was designed to automatically set this field to the current user.

### 3. Missing Permission Checks
The `BunkLogsInfoByDateViewSet` had `permission_classes = [AllowAny]`, allowing any authenticated user to access any bunk's data, regardless of their role or assignments.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed URL Names in Tests
**File:** `bunk_logs/api/tests/test_permissions.py`
- Updated all test methods to use correct URL names:
  - `reverse('bunk-logs-info', ...)` → `reverse('bunklog-by-date', ...)`
  - `reverse('bunklogs-list')` → `reverse('bunklog-list')`

### 2. Made Counselor Field Auto-Set
**File:** `bunk_logs/api/serializers.py`
- Modified `BunkLogSerializer` to make `counselor` field read-only
- Added explicit field definition: `counselor = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(read_only=True)`
- Updated docstring to clarify that counselor is automatically set

### 3. Implemented Proper Permission Checking
**File:** `bunk_logs/api/views.py`
- Changed `BunkLogsInfoByDateViewSet` permissions from `AllowAny` to `IsAuthenticated`
- Added role-based access control:
  - **Admin/Staff**: Can access all bunks
  - **Unit Heads**: Can only access bunks in their managed units
  - **Counselors**: Can only access bunks they are assigned to
  - **Others**: Access denied
- Fixed Bunk import scope issue

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
FAILED (errors=5)
- 5 tests failing with NoReverseMatch and permission errors
- 4 tests passing
```

### After Fix
```
OK
- All 9 tests passing
- No errors or failures
```

## Files Modified
1. `bunk_logs/api/tests/test_permissions.py` - Fixed URL names in all test methods
2. `bunk_logs/api/serializers.py` - Made counselor field read-only in BunkLogSerializer
3. `bunk_logs/api/views.py` - Added proper permission checking to BunkLogsInfoByDateViewSet

## Impact
- ✅ All tests now pass
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline should work correctly
- ✅ Proper security: Users can only access data they're authorized to see
- ✅ API works as designed: Counselor field is automatically set from authenticated user

## Testing
Verified with:
```bash
./dev.sh test bunk_logs.api.tests.test_permissions.CounselorPermissionsTest -v 2
./dev.sh test  # All tests
```

Both commands show all tests passing successfully.
