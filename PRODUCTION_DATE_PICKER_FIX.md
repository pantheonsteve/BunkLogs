# Production Date Picker Fix - API Configuration Issue ‚úÖ

## Problem Identified
The SingleDatePicker date restrictions were working locally but **not in production on Render**.

## Root Cause
**Incorrect API Call Configuration**: The SingleDatePicker was using `fetch()` with a relative URL instead of the configured API instance.

### Issues:
1. **Local**: Relative URL `/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/` ‚Üí `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/` ‚úÖ
2. **Production**: Relative URL `/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/` ‚Üí `https://frontend-domain/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/` ‚ùå (Wrong domain!)

## The Fix

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/${user.id}/`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
import api from '../../api'

const response = await api.get(`/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/${user.id}/`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

## Environment Configuration Verified

### Local Development (.env.local):
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Production (.env.production):
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://admin.bunklogs.net
```

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Debugging:
```javascript
console.log('API base URL:', api.defaults.baseURL);
console.log('Full API URL will be:', `${api.defaults.baseURL}/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/${user.id}/`);
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling:
- Updated to handle axios response format instead of fetch
- Better 404 handling for users without assignments
- Graceful fallback to allow all dates on API errors

## Deployment Steps

### For Frontend (where deployed):
1. **Rebuild** the frontend with the updated SingleDatePicker
2. **Deploy** to Render (or wherever frontend is hosted)
3. **Clear browser cache** to ensure new code is loaded
4. **Test** with production user credentials

### Verification Steps:
1. Login to production app as camper care user (cc1@clc.org)
2. Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Click on date picker
4. Verify API call goes to `https://admin.bunklogs.net/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/26/`
5. Check Console tab for debug logs showing correct API URL
6. Confirm dates before June 19, 2025 are disabled

## Expected Production Behavior
After deployment, the date picker should:
- ‚úÖ Make API calls to correct backend domain (`https://admin.bunklogs.net`)
- ‚úÖ Fetch user assignment data successfully
- ‚úÖ Restrict dates before June 19, 2025 for both Unit Head and Camper Care users
- ‚úÖ Allow dates from June 19, 2025 onwards
- ‚úÖ Show debug logs with correct API URLs

## Notes
- The fix ensures consistent API behavior between local and production
- All other components already use the `api` instance correctly
- SingleDatePicker was the only component using raw `fetch()` calls
- Environment variables are correctly configured for both environments

This fix resolves the production deployment issue and ensures date picker restrictions work consistently across all environments! üéØ
