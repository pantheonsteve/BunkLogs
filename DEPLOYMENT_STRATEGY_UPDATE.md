# Deployment Strategy Update - Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

Your deployment strategy has been successfully updated to separate frontend and backend deployments:

### ✅ What Was Done

1. **Created New Frontend-Only Deployment Workflow**
   - New file: `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml`
   - Triggers only on frontend changes (`frontend/**` path filter)
   - Deploys to Google Cloud Storage with CDN
   - Includes cache invalidation and health checks

2. **Disabled Old Deployment Workflows**
   - Renamed `deploy.yml` → `deploy-backend-old.yml.disabled`
   - Renamed `deploy-production.yml` → `deploy-production-old.yml.disabled`
   - These are preserved but won't run automatically

3. **Updated Backend Settings for Render.com**
   - Created `config/settings/render.py` for Render.com deployment
   - Updated CORS settings to include Google Cloud Storage URLs
   - Added support for Render.com domain patterns

4. **Created Documentation and Setup Tools**
   - `FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment guide
   - `scripts/setup-frontend-deployment.sh` - Helper script for setup

### 🔧 Required Setup Steps

1. **Set GitHub Secrets** (Required before deployment works):
   ```
   GCP_SA_KEY          - Google Cloud service account JSON key
   RENDER_BACKEND_URL  - Your Render.com backend URL
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID    - Google OAuth client ID
   ```

2. **Configure Render.com Backend**:
   - Set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.render`
   - Set `FRONTEND_URL=https://clc.bunklogs.net`
   - Add other required environment variables

3. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Point `bunklogs.net` to the Load Balancer IP (from deployment logs)

### 🚀 How It Works Now

**Frontend Deployment (Automatic)**:
- Push changes to `frontend/` directory in main branch
- GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys to Google Cloud Storage
- CDN cache is invalidated for immediate updates
- Frontend is available at `https://clc.bunklogs.net`

**Backend Deployment (Manual)**:
- Deploy directly to Render.com when needed
- Use the new `render.py` settings file
- Frontend will automatically connect to your Render.com backend

### 📁 File Changes Summary

```
New Files:
├── .github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml
├── backend/config/settings/render.py
├── FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
└── scripts/setup-frontend-deployment.sh

Renamed Files:
├── .github/workflows/deploy-backend-old.yml.disabled
└── .github/workflows/deploy-production-old.yml.disabled

Modified Files:
└── backend/config/settings/base.py (updated CORS for Render.com)
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the setup helper**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-frontend-deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Set up GitHub secrets** using the URLs provided by the script

3. **Deploy your backend to Render.com** using the new settings:
   ```bash
   # On Render.com, set:
   DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.render
   ```

4. **Test frontend deployment** by making a small change to `frontend/` and pushing to main

5. **Configure DNS** for bunklogs.net domain

### 💡 Benefits

- **Faster deployments**: Frontend and backend deploy independently
- **Cost savings**: No more Cloud Run costs for backend
- **Simplified backend**: Direct Render.com deployment
- **Global CDN**: Fast frontend loading worldwide
- **Easy rollbacks**: Previous versions preserved

### 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all GitHub secrets are set correctly
3. Ensure Render.com backend has correct CORS settings
4. Check DNS configuration for bunklogs.net

Your deployment strategy is now ready! The separation allows for independent scaling and deployment of your frontend and backend services.
