# Unit Head Multiple Assignments Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem Identified
Unit Head users assigned to multiple units could only see bunks from their first unit assignment, not all units they were assigned to.

## Root Cause
**API Response Structure Mismatch**: 
- **Backend returns**: Array of units `[{id: 1, name: "Unit A", bunks: [...]}, {id: 2, name: "Unit B", bunks: [...]}]`
- **Frontend was handling**: Only the first unit `response.data[0]` instead of all units

## The Fix
Updated `UnitHeadBunkGrid.jsx` to properly handle multiple unit assignments, following the same pattern as the Camper Care fix:

### Before:
```javascript
const response = await api.get(`/api/v1/unithead/${user.id}/${dateToUse}/`);
// The API returns an array of units, we need the first unit
let data = null;
if (Array.isArray(response.data) && response.data.length > 0) {
  data = response.data[0]; // ❌ Only takes FIRST unit!
}
```

### After:
```javascript
const response = await api.get(`/api/v1/unithead/${user.id}/${dateToUse}/`);
// The API returns an array of units - handle multiple unit assignments
const units = response.data;
let data = null;

if (units && units.length > 0) {
  const primaryUnit = units[0];
  
  // Handle multiple units by combining bunks
  if (units.length > 1) {
    const allBunks = units.flatMap(unit => {
      return (unit.bunks || []).map(bunk => ({ 
        ...bunk, 
        unit_name: unit.name 
      }));
    });
    
    data = {
      ...primaryUnit,
      name: `${primaryUnit.name} (+${units.length - 1} more)`,
      bunks: allBunks
    };
  } else {
    data = {
      ...primaryUnit,
      bunks: (primaryUnit.bunks || []).map(bunk => ({ 
        ...bunk, 
        unit_name: primaryUnit.name 
      }))
    };
  }
  
  // Collect campers from ALL units for attention tracking
  units.forEach(unit => {
    // Process all units...
  });
}
```

## Benefits
✅ **Multiple Unit Support**: Unit heads can now see ALL units they're assigned to
✅ **Combined View**: When assigned to multiple units, bunks are combined with clear labeling
✅ **Context Preservation**: Each bunk maintains its unit context for clarity
✅ **Attention Tracking**: Campers needing attention are tracked across ALL assigned units
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Single unit assignments continue to work as before

## Technical Details
- **Modified File**: `frontend/src/partials/dashboard/UnitHeadBunkGrid.jsx`
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/v1/unithead/{user_id}/{date}/`
- **Backend Response**: Array of units with UnitStaffAssignment support
- **Frontend Handling**: Combines bunks from multiple units into unified view

## Expected Behavior
When a unit head is assigned to multiple units:
- **Dashboard Title**: Shows primary unit name with "+X more" indicator
- **Bunk Cards**: Shows bunks from ALL assigned units
- **Statistics**: Counts reflect totals across ALL units
- **Attention Alerts**: Include campers from ALL units

## Verification
Unit heads can now:
1. See all bunks from all units they're assigned to
2. Access combined statistics (total bunks, campers, staff)
3. View help requests and attention alerts from all units
4. Navigate to individual bunk pages across all their units

This fix provides **complete parity** between single and multiple unit assignments for Unit Head users! 🎯
