# Date Picker Implementation - Final Testing Guide

## âœ… COMPLETED WORK

### Backend Changes
1. **API Endpoint Updated**: `/api/v1/unit-staff-assignments/{id}/` now uses `staff_member__id` as lookup
2. **Serializer Enhanced**: `UnitStaffAssignmentSerializer` includes `start_date` and `end_date`
3. **Error Handling**: Proper 404 responses for missing assignments
4. **Test Command**: Added `./podman-manage.sh test-staff-assignment` for testing

### Frontend Changes
1. **SingleDatePicker Enhanced**: Fetches assignment dates and restricts selectable dates
2. **Date Validation**: Handles null end_date (ongoing assignments) correctly
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when no assignment found
4. **Test Page**: Created `/test-datepicker` route for testing

### Verified Test Data
- **User ID 26 (CamperCare One)**: Assignment from 2025-06-19 to ongoing
- **User ID 23 (UnitHead One)**: Assignment from 2025-06-19 to ongoing

## ðŸ§ª MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED

### Steps to Verify Everything Works:

1. **Backend Test** (âœ… Already confirmed working):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/steve.bresnick/Projects/BunkLogs
   ./podman-manage.sh test-staff-assignment --user-id 26
   ```

2. **Frontend Test**:
   - Open: http://localhost:3000/test-datepicker
   - Open browser dev tools (F12) â†’ Console tab
   - Look for these logs:
     - "Test user set in localStorage: {id: 26, ...}"
     - "Assignment data: {start_date: '2025-06-19', end_date: null, ...}"
     - "Setting allowed range: {start_date: '2025-06-19', end_date: '2025-06-24'}"

3. **Date Picker Functionality**:
   - Click on the date picker to open calendar
   - Hover over different dates and check console for "isDateDisabled called with:" logs
   - **VERIFY**: Dates before June 19, 2025 are grayed out and unclickable
   - **VERIFY**: Dates from June 19, 2025 onwards are selectable
   - **VERIFY**: Current date (June 24, 2025) is selectable

4. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - Edit test page to use User ID 23 instead of 26
   - Verify same behavior (both have identical date ranges)
   - Test with a non-existent user ID to verify fallback behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### Correct Date Picker Behavior:
- **Disabled dates**: All dates before June 19, 2025 (grayed out, unclickable)
- **Enabled dates**: June 19, 2025 onwards (clickable, selectable)
- **No end date restriction**: Since end_date is null, all future dates allowed

### Console Output Should Show:
```
Test user set in localStorage: {id: 26, first_name: "CamperCare", ...}
Assignment data: {start_date: "2025-06-19", end_date: null, ...}
Setting allowed range: {start_date: "2025-06-19", end_date: "2025-06-24"}
isDateDisabled called with: [date] allowedRange: {...}
Date check: {
  checkDate: "...",
  startDate: "2025-06-19T04:00:00.000Z",
  endDate: "null (ongoing)",
  beforeStartDate: true/false,
  afterEndDate: false,
  isDisabled: true/false
}
```

## ðŸš€ PRODUCTION READY STEPS

Once manual testing confirms everything works:

1. **Remove Debug Logs**:
   ```bash
   # Remove all console.log statements from SingleDatePicker.jsx
   ```

2. **Test All Dashboard Pages**:
   - CounselorDashboard.jsx
   - CamperCareDashboard.jsx
   - UnitHeadDashboard.jsx
   - BunkDashboard.jsx

3. **Remove Test Files**:
   - Delete `frontend/src/pages/DatePickerTest.jsx`
   - Remove test route from `frontend/src/Router.jsx`
   - Delete test HTML file

4. **Deploy**:
   - Commit changes
   - Deploy to staging/production

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL SUMMARY

### Key Implementation Details:
- **Lookup Field**: Changed from assignment ID to `staff_member__id`
- **Date Handling**: Proper null handling for ongoing assignments
- **API Integration**: Frontend fetches dates on component mount
- **Date Restriction**: Uses react-day-picker's `disabled` prop
- **Error Fallback**: Allows all dates if assignment not found

### Files Modified:
- `backend/bunk_logs/api/views.py`
- `backend/bunk_logs/api/serializers.py`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/SingleDatePicker.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/DatePickerTest.jsx` (test only)
- `frontend/src/Router.jsx` (test route)
- `podman-manage.sh` (test command)

The implementation is complete and ready for final verification!
