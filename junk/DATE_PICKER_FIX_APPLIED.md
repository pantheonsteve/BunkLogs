# Date Picker Fix Applied ✅

## Problem Identified
The date picker was not properly restricting dates before June 19, 2025 for User ID 23 (UnitHead One). 

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. Incorrect User Data Access
- **Issue**: SingleDatePicker was looking for `user_id` in localStorage
- **Reality**: The app uses AuthContext with `useAuth()` hook and `user.id`
- **Fix**: Updated to use `const { user, token } = useAuth()` and access `user.id`

### 2. Incorrect End Date Handling
- **Issue**: When `end_date` was null (ongoing assignment), it was setting a fallback to today's date
- **Problem**: This restricted future date selection to only today
- **Fix**: Keep `end_date` as null to allow all future dates when assignment is ongoing

## Changes Made

### Updated SingleDatePicker.jsx:
1. Added `import { useAuth } from '../../auth/AuthContext'`
2. Changed user/token access from localStorage to `useAuth()` hook
3. Updated useEffect dependency array to `[user, token]`
4. Fixed null end_date handling to allow ongoing assignments

## Expected Behavior Now
For User ID 23 (UnitHead One) with assignment starting June 19, 2025:
- ❌ **Disabled**: All dates before June 19, 2025 (grayed out, unclickable)
- ✅ **Enabled**: June 19, 2025 and all future dates (clickable, selectable)

## Test Instructions
1. Refresh the UnitHead dashboard page
2. Click on the date picker
3. Verify dates June 1-18, 2025 are grayed out and unclickable
4. Verify dates June 19, 2025 onwards are selectable
5. Check browser console for debug logs showing correct date range data

The fix ensures the date picker correctly restricts selections based on each user's specific staff assignment start and end dates.
