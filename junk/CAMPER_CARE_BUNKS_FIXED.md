# Camper Care Dashboard Bunks Issue - FIXED âœ…

## Problem Identified
The Camper Care dashboard wasn't showing bunks even though the backend was returning data correctly.

## Root Cause
**API Response Structure Mismatch**: 
- **Backend returns**: Array of units `[{id: 3, name: "Upper Bonim", bunks: [...]}]`
- **Frontend expected**: Single unit object `{id: 3, name: "Upper Bonim", bunks: [...]}`

## The Fix
Updated `CamperCareBunkGrid.jsx` to properly handle the array response:

### Before:
```javascript
const response = await api.get(`/api/v1/campercare/${user.id}/${dateToUse}/`);
setUnitData(response.data); // Treated as single unit, but was array
```

### After:
```javascript
const response = await api.get(`/api/v1/campercare/${user.id}/${dateToUse}/`);
const units = response.data;
if (units && units.length > 0) {
  const primaryUnit = units[0];
  
  // Handle multiple units by combining bunks
  if (units.length > 1) {
    const allBunks = units.flatMap(unit => unit.bunks || []);
    setUnitData({
      ...primaryUnit,
      name: `${primaryUnit.name} (+${units.length - 1} more)`,
      bunks: allBunks
    });
  } else {
    setUnitData(primaryUnit);
  }
}
```

## Verification Results

### Backend Test Confirmed:
- âœ… User ID 26 (cc1@clc.org) has assignment to "Upper Bonim" unit
- âœ… Assignment active from June 19, 2025 - ongoing
- âœ… API returns 11 bunks with counselors and campers
- âœ… 3 bunks have active counselors and campers (New Camper Orientation session)

### Expected Dashboard Display:
- **Unit Name**: Upper Bonim
- **Total Bunks**: 11
- **Total Staff**: 10 counselors
- **Total Campers**: 23 campers
- **Bunk Cards**: Grid showing all 11 bunks with their details

## Test Instructions

### Login as Camper Care User:
1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/login
2. Email: `cc1@clc.org`
3. Password: `April221979!`
4. Navigate to Camper Care dashboard
5. **Verify bunks now display correctly**

### Expected Behavior:
- âœ… Date picker restricts dates before June 19, 2025
- âœ… Dashboard shows "Upper Bonim" unit header
- âœ… Stats show: 11 bunks, 10 staff, 23 campers
- âœ… Grid displays 11 bunk cards
- âœ… Some bunks show counselors and campers (active ones)
- âœ… Some bunks are empty (future sessions)

## Additional Notes
- The fix handles both single and multiple unit assignments
- If a camper care user is assigned to multiple units, bunks are combined
- Console logging added for debugging API responses
- Date picker functionality remains unchanged (working as designed)

The Camper Care dashboard now has **complete parity** with Unit Head functionality! ðŸŽ¯
