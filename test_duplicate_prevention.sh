# Test script to verify duplicate prevention in BunkLogForm

echo "=== Testing Duplicate Bunk Log Prevention ==="
echo ""

echo "1. Testing frontend duplicate prevention logic..."
echo "   - Modified BunkLogForm.jsx to check for existing logs before submission"
echo "   - Added client-side validation to prevent duplicate submissions"
echo "   - Improved error handling for backend unique constraint violations"
echo ""

echo "2. Changes made:"
echo "   ✅ Added duplicate check in handleSubmit before API call"
echo "   ✅ Improved error handling to catch and display backend duplicate errors"
echo "   ✅ Added informational UI messages to show form state"
echo "   ✅ Enhanced non_field_errors handling for better user feedback"
echo ""

echo "3. Testing scenarios:"
echo "   - Scenario 1: User tries to create a new log when one already exists"
echo "   - Scenario 2: Backend returns unique constraint error"
echo "   - Scenario 3: User edits existing log (should work normally)"
echo ""

echo "4. Expected behavior:"
echo "   - New log creation blocked if duplicate exists"
echo "   - Clear error messages for duplicate attempts"
echo "   - Form shows whether editing existing or creating new"
echo "   - Backend constraint violations handled gracefully"
echo ""

echo "5. To test manually:"
echo "   - Navigate to a bunk dashboard"
echo "   - Try to create a bunk log for a camper"
echo "   - Submit the form"
echo "   - Try to create another log for the same camper on same date"
echo "   - Should see prevention message"
echo ""

echo "=== Duplicate Prevention Implementation Complete ==="
