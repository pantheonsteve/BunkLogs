# Test script for counselor log submission fix

echo "🧪 Testing Counselor Log Submission Fix"
echo "========================================"
echo ""

echo "📅 Current Date Information:"
echo "System date: $(date)"
echo "Local date (YYYY-MM-DD): $(date '+%Y-%m-%d')"
echo "UTC date: $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d')"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Changes Made:"
echo "1. ✅ Fixed timezone issue in date validation"
echo "2. ✅ Updated error message from 'bunklogs' to 'counselor logs'"
echo "3. ✅ Allow counselors to submit logs for today and past dates (up to 30 days)"
echo "4. ✅ Fixed canEdit() function to use local timezone"
echo "5. ✅ Fixed isDateInFuture() function to use local timezone"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix:"
echo "- Counselors can submit logs for today's date: ✅ ALLOWED"
echo "- Counselors can submit logs for past dates (up to 30 days): ✅ ALLOWED"
echo "- Counselors cannot submit logs for future dates: ❌ BLOCKED"
echo "- Error message correctly mentions 'counselor logs' not 'bunklogs': ✅ FIXED"
echo ""

echo "🚨 Root Cause Identified:"
echo "The validation was using new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0] which:"
echo "- Converts to UTC timezone"
echo "- In Eastern timezone (UTC-4), 9:51 PM July 11 becomes July 12 UTC"
echo "- This made the validation think 'today' was July 12"
echo "- When counselors tried to submit for July 11 (actual local date), it was blocked as 'past date'"
echo ""

echo "💡 Solution Applied:"
echo "Changed all date comparisons to use local timezone:"
echo "  const now = new Date();"
echo "  const today = now.getFullYear() + '-' + "
echo "               String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0') + '-' + "
echo "               String(now.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');"
echo ""

echo "📋 Manual Testing Steps:"
echo "1. Log in as a counselor"
echo "2. Navigate to counselor dashboard for today's date"
echo "3. Try to create a counselor log - should work ✅"
echo "4. Try to create a counselor log for yesterday - should work ✅"
echo "5. Try to create a counselor log for tomorrow - should be blocked ❌"
echo "6. Verify error messages mention 'counselor logs' not 'bunklogs'"

echo "🚀 Ready for Testing!"
echo "The counselor log submission issue should now be resolved."
