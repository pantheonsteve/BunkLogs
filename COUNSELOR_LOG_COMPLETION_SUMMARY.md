## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### Modal State Issue (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: CounselorLog modal was immediately closing after opening due to component re-initialization.

**Root Causes Identified & Fixed**:
1. **useEffect Dependency Issues**: Modal event handlers were missing proper dependency arrays, causing re-registration on every render
2. **Component Re-mounting**: Date navigation was causing dashboard component to re-mount and reset modal state
3. **Navigation During Modal**: Date picker changes were triggering navigation while modal was open

**Solutions Implemented**:
```jsx
// 1. Fixed useEffect dependencies in CounselorLogFormModal
useEffect(() => {
  const clickHandler = ({ target }) => {
    if (!modalOpen || modalContent.current?.contains(target)) return
    setModalOpen(false);
  };
  document.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);
  return () => document.removeEventListener('click', clickHandler);
}, [modalOpen, setModalOpen]); // ← Added missing dependencies

// 2. Prevented navigation when modal is open
const handleDateChange = (newDate) => {
  if (counselorLogModalOpen) {
    return; // Don't navigate if modal is open
  }
  // ... navigation logic
};

// 3. Added early return for redirect useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  if (!date || date === 'undefined') {
    navigate(`/counselor-dashboard/${formattedDate}`, { replace: true });
    return; // Exit early to avoid setting up the rest of the component
  }
}, [date, navigate]);
```
