- Cleaned up old/expired service account keys
- **Generated new key that needs to be updated in GitHub secrets**

## üîß FINAL ACTION REQUIRED

### Update GitHub Secret (Manual Step)
The new service account key has been generated. You need to:

1. **Go to GitHub Repository:**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/[your-username]/BunkLogs
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

2. **Update GCP_SA_KEY Secret:**
   - Find the `GCP_SA_KEY` secret and click "Update"
   - Copy the JSON content from the terminal output above
   - Paste it as the new secret value (including the curly braces)
   - Save the secret

3. **Test the Fix:**
   - Push any commit to the main branch
   - Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Should now deploy successfully without authentication errors

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Backend Tests | ‚úÖ PASSING | All 9 tests pass locally |
| Frontend Tests | ‚úÖ PASSING | 4 Vitest tests pass locally |
| GitHub Actions Syntax | ‚úÖ VALID | Workflow file is properly configured |
| Service Account | ‚úÖ READY | New key generated with proper permissions |
| GitHub Secret | ‚è≥ PENDING | Manual update required |

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE

Once the GitHub secret is updated, the complete CI/CD pipeline will:

1. **Test Phase:**
   - Run backend Django tests with PostgreSQL
   - Run frontend Vitest tests with jsdom
   - Build frontend for production

2. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Authenticate to Google Cloud ‚úÖ 
   - Build Docker image via Cloud Build
   - Deploy to Cloud Run with gradual traffic migration
   - Run database migrations
   - Collect static files

3. **Deploy Frontend:**
   - Build optimized frontend bundle
   - Deploy to Google Cloud Storage
   - Configure CDN and cache headers
   - Set up HTTPS with SSL certificates

## üîí SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Implemented proper permissions for Admin/Staff, Unit Heads, and Counselors
- **Authentication Required:** Changed BunkLogsInfoByDateViewSet from AllowAny to IsAuthenticated
